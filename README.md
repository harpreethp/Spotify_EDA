# Spotify_EDA

A dataset of 2017 songs with attributes from Spotify's API. Each song is labeled "1" meaning I like it and "0" for songs I don't like. There are 16 columns. 13 of which are song attributes, one column for song name, one for artist, and a column called "target" which is the label for the song.

Here are the 13 track attributes: acousticness, danceability, duration_ms, energy, instrumentalness, key, liveness, loudness, mode, speechiness, tempo, time_signature, valence. Dataset was taken from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/geomack/spotifyclassification
